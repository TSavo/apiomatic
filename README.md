Round-trip API generation using Spring and Hibernate.

Step 1: Have an example of your data in JSON? 

APIOMatic will generate the JPA Entities, the DAO layer, and the RESTful controllers for you.

Step 2: Have a set of Entities and some RESTful controllers (or just generated them in the prior step)?

APIOMatic will generate a descriptor of your API called an API Schema suitible for consumption by other automated processes (keep reading!).

Step 3: Have a API Schema? 

Now you can generate the following:

HTML Documentation... in any dialect.
Clients of the API... in any programming language.
Integration tests for the API which can be automated... or exported for unit testing suite.
Example usages... in any language.
API dummy stubs for testing your clients against... in any language.
Example JSON... 

...which brings us back to step 1!
